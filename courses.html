    <li>ENEE200: Technology and Consequences: Engineering, Ethics, and Humanity<div class='dropdown-content'>
            <p>What makes a technology socially responsible? At UMD, the Fearless Ideas campaign asks us to
                aim our enthusiasm for
                technology at big real problems. At the same time, we are coming to appreciate the
                increasingly complex nature of
                technological systems as they become integrated into all forms of infrastructure, we realize
                they may be unpredictable,
                interdependent on social and biological systems, and have unintended consequences. In this
                midst of this complexity,
                people make decisions with far reaching impacts. How then do we follow our passion for
                technology and innovation but
                also stay skeptical in a way that allows us to consider the potential and shortcomings of
                technology? Designed for both
                engineering and non-engineering students wishing to explore and assess the impact of
                engineeri ng technology on society
                and the role of society in generating that technology.</p>
