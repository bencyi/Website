                <li>CMSC131: Object-Oriented Programming I<div class='dropdown-content'>
                        <p>Introduction to programming and computer science. Emphasizes understanding and implementation
                            of applications using
                            object-oriented techniques. Develops skills such as program design and testing as well as
                            implementation of programs
                            using a graphical IDE. Programming done in Java.</p>

                        <p>Introduction to use of computers to solve problems using software engineering principles.
                            Design, build, test, and debug
                            medium -size software systems and learn to use relevant tools. Use object-oriented methods
                            to create effective and
                            efficient problem solutions. Use and implement application programming interfaces (APIs).
                            Programming done in Java.</p>

                        <p>What makes a technology socially responsible? At UMD, the Fearless Ideas campaign asks us to
                            aim our enthusiasm for
                            technology at big real problems. At the same time, we are coming to appreciate the
                            increasingly complex nature of
                            technological systems as they become integrated into all forms of infrastructure, we realize
                            they may be unpredictable,
                            interdependent on social and biological systems, and have unintended consequences. In this
                            midst of this complexity,
                            people make decisions with far reaching impacts. How then do we follow our passion for
                            technology and innovation but
                            also stay skeptical in a way that allows us to consider the potential and shortcomings of
                            technology? Designed for both
                            engineering and non-engineering students wishing to explore and assess the impact of
                            engineering technology on society
                            and the role of society in generating that technology.</p>
